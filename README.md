- **Amazon RDS** – Relational database setup and connectivity.
- **AWS Amplify** – Full-stack serverless web app hosting.
- **Amazon Cognito** – User authentication and authorization.
- **Amazon CloudWatch** – Logging and monitoring AWS resources.
- **EC2** – Virtual server setup.
- **S3** – Scalable object storage.
- **VPC** – Custom networking with public/private subnets.

###  Compute & Storage
- **Amazon EC2** – Launch and manage virtual servers.
- **Amazon S3** – Scalable object storage for files and datasets.
- **Amazon RDS** – Managed relational database service for PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.
